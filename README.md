# About me

A native of Lancaster, PA, I have lived, worked, and studied in Pittsburgh since 2014. My work seeks to preserve and promote free expression in all forms, from the personal to the political to the artistic.

I studied political science, sociology, and legal studies at Pitt. While studying I worked with the ACLU of Pennsylvania to advance the civil liberties of those incarcerated in the Commonwealth. From there I served as an editorial intern at SampsoniaWay.org, City of Asylum's online magazine, helping give voice to writers around the world who fight against censorship and oppression.

I then spent two and a half years working on staff at City of Asylum as the organization transitioned from the alley where it was formed to its new home and venue at Alphabet City. In their new space, I oversaw the production of over 200 readings, concerts, film screenings, and community events which sought to elevate lesser-heard voices and promote cross-cultural exchange.

Now I am pursuing my master's degree in public policy and management at the Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University with a focus on data analytics. I hope to use the tools and skills I acquire in this program to ensure access to public services for all and address inadequacies in the legal system, such as bias in criminal justice and a lack of meaningful digital privacy protections.

# What I hope to learn

In this class I hope to learn how to better utilize geospatial data to solve public issues. Much of our lives are lived in the physical world, and the physical space in which problems regarding public services manifest matter. To that end I hope to learn to utilize tools that exist outside the expensive ESRI ecosystem, so that they may be utilized by under-resourced people, communities, and organizations.

I also hope to learn to better develop my ArcGIS Pro skills to glean additional insight from the datasets I've worked with in the past. This could include mapping local areas to identify food and transit deserts.

I also want to learn how to utilize GIS in a larger context. I understand many project have a GIS component to them yet may not be fully geospatial, so learning how to utilize these tools within a larger context would also prove useful.
